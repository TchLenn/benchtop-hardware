## Warning
While it is possible to mount and use Edmund Platinum 0.5x telecentric lens with this mount, the galvo scanning range (for Thorlsbs 15-mm beam galvos) 
is too high to cover such large FOV at required frequency (100 Hz). As a result, the galvo flaps with weird noises.

So, use this lens at your own risk, possibly with smaller and lighter galvos, high-perfomance galvo driver, and watch for scanning issues.
